Homework for EPAM courses

## Lesson1(Udemy)
Task on five topics:
- Basic Exercices
- Data types
- Conditional Statements
- For loop
- Arrays
from the course [C# Basics - For Complete Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/c-sharp-basics-for-complete-newbies/) from the Udemy

## Lesson4
Asymptotic time complexity of both algorithms ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?O%28n%5E2%29). However, the real time complexity of the algorithms is different. Each sorting is made 100 times.

|Number of elements in the array|Bubble sort time|Optimized bubble sort time|How usual sorting faster than optimized|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|100|0.059|0.027|2.19|
|1000|23.2|10.32|2.25|
|10000|1146.25|641.04|1.79|
|100000|101381|61144|1.66|

It is not necessary to increase the number of elements in the arranged array, as sorting takes a lot of time. As we can see, the time difference between algorithms decreases.
