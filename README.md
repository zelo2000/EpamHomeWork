Homework for EPAM courses

## Lesson1(Udemy)
Task on five topics:
- Basic Exercices
- Data types
- Conditional Statements
- For loop
- Arrays
from the course [C# Basics - For Complete Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/c-sharp-basics-for-complete-newbies/) from the Udemy

## Lesson4
Asymptotic time complexity of both algorithms O(n^2). However, the real time complexity of the algorithms is different. Each sorting is made 100 times.

|Number of elements in the array|Bubble sort time|Optimized bubble sort time|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|100|0.059|0.027|
|1000|23.2|10.32|
|10000|1146.25|641.04|

It is not necessary to increase the number of elements in the arranged array, as sorting takes a lot of time.
